# Data-Mining---Unsupervised-Learning
### Clustering:

What we learnt: Classfication and Regression problem.
D = {Xi, Yi}: data set
Yi : {0,1} -> 2-class classification problem
Yi : IR -> Regression
Y = F(x)
Clustring:
Given bunch of data points, no Yi's
Given is just D={Xi}
Task: group or cluster similar data points.
How do you measure how well my algorithm performed if Yi is not given?

Clustering (Unsupervised learning) ->No Yi's to supervise learning. 
Classification and regression - supervised learning algos since given Xi and Yi.

Semi-supervised learning:
D = D1 U D2.
D1 -> {Xi, Yi} -> Small problem.
D2= {Xi} ->Large problem

Applications of clustering: -> used in Data Mining. 
go to Wiki:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cluster_analysis

Example used on eCommerce:
Amazon, Alibaba, Ebay, Flipkart.
Task: Group similar customers based on their purchasing behavior. how much money used, credit card, income limit, geo area.
if I group by purchasing behavior:
So If I create example 5 clusters based on purchasing behaviors and create deals.
deal -> C1, C2, C3, C4, C5.

These deals are created based on customer's behaviors. 

Second problem:
#### Image segmentation:

I can segment/regions image based on part. grouping/clustering similar pixels. to detect image.
Typically, ML algo to perform obj detection.
